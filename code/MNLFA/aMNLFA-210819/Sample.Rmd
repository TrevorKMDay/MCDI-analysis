# 3.	Draw a calibration sample.
# Sample one calibration per ID. Outputs a calibration file. Was originally designed for independent obs. Build initial models w/ calib sample. 
#do for a couple of calibration samples to check robustness.

# 4.	Create Mplus input files for mean impact, variance impact, 
# and item-by-item measurement non-invariance (aMNLFA.initial)
#makes initial models, populated in folder w/ MPlus input files wa
####################################################

# aMNLFA.simultaneous(ob)

##################################
#5a. NEW: Shows which effects will be significant based on different thresholds. 
# First, it will give you alphas corresponding to two possible options for how to the number of tests m: (1) set as the number of all possible tests (i.e., the number of items multiplied by the number of covariates; shown as "ibc" in the results); or (2) the number of tests actually included in the simultaneous model, shown as "actual" in the results. 
# Second, it will give you the option to use either (1) a Benjamini-Hochberg correction, shown as "BH" in the results; or (2) a Bonferroni correction, shown as "bon" in the results. 
# Third, if you're testing threshold DIF, it will give you the results if you trim non-significant effects based on (1) all categories' thresholds for each item, shown as "tdif" in the results; and (2) the category with the highest test statistic for each item, shown as "intdif" in the results. 
# The main difference here is that the aMNLFA.prune() function creates a different type of object (i.e., not an aMNLFA.object), which can be inspected and passed to aMNLFA.plot(). This function will give you plots for each different type of DIF parameter you have, as well as how your decisions would change based on different thresholds. So, as an example, suppose you have an aMNLFA.object called some.object. You could do:
##################################
source(paste(homedir, 'aMNLFA_prune.R', sep = '/'))
prune.object <- aMNLFA.prune(ob) #makes an object with DIF by various kinds of MC strategies 



##################################
#5b. NEW: makes plot of intercept and loading DIF to show what would be signfiicant based on different thresholds. you will need to manually save these out. 
##################################
source(paste(homedir, 'aMNLFA_DIFplot.R', sep ='/'))
aMNLFA.DIFplot(prune.object, "loading", log = FALSE) #makes plot of loading DIF by MC strategies 

aMNLFA.DIFplot(prune.object, "intercept", log = FALSE) #makes plot of intercept DIF by MC strategies 


##################################
# 6. Trim non-sig terms.  
################################
source(paste(homedir, 'aMNLFA_final.R', sep = '/')) #gets IS's corrected version 
aMNLFA.final(ob, mchoice = "actual", method = "BH", keepmean=TRUE) #MAKE SURE BH IS CAPITALIZED!!!
runModels(homedir, replaceOutfile = 'never') 

##################################
# 7. (only for longitudinal data) Use parameter values generated from the last calibration model to fix
# parameter values in the scoring model using the full, longitudinal dataset
################################
source(paste(homedir, 'aMNLFA.scores.R', sep = '/'))
aMNLFA.scores(ob)
runModels(homedir, replaceOutfile = 'never') 

#The resulting Mplus script uses the long (mr.dat) data file and outputs factor
# score estimates for each observation. Run the resulting scores.inp script manually.
# This script produces a file containing factor score estimates if data are cross-sectional.


##################################
# 8. Describe and visualize factor score estimates and generate empirical item
# characteristic curves
##################################
# NOTE: Step 7 saves "scores.dat" in the wrong directory (was in my root dir). 
# Need to move this file to wdir before running this last line. 
source(paste(homedir,'aMNLFA_scoreplots.R', sep = '/'))
